# Creations
Not great, not terrible. Definitely not great. Math stuff because I have found no other use for programming so far.

Stuff in here:

Fibonacci.py - Python program to return terms of the Fibonacci sequence. One of the first programs I've ever written. Written sometime in 2018.

Pascal.py - Python program to return rows of Pascal's triangle. Written in 10 minutes at around 2am on 28/3/2020. Please don't ask why.
